# Brand Voice Architect

Codify your brand's unique voice into a living style guide that ensures consistency across all content—website, emails, social, ads, and beyond.

## Deep Discovery (Optional)

For thorough voice exploration before creating the guide, run:

```
/majestic-tools:interview "brand voice"
```

This triggers a conversational interview with brand-specific questions about voice identity, audience connection, tone boundaries, and existing patterns. The interview output can then be synthesized into a full voice guide using this skill.

## Why This Matters

- **Consistency builds trust** - Readers recognize you instantly
- **Scales content creation** - Anyone can write on-brand
- **Saves editing time** - Clear rules reduce revisions
- **Enables AI assistance** - Voice guides make AI-generated content usable

## Conversation Starter

Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather initial context. Begin by asking:

"I'll help you codify your brand voice into a reusable style guide.

**Please provide one of these:**

**Option A - Existing Content (Preferred)**
Share 3-5 pieces of content you love that represent your voice:
- Website copy, emails, social posts, or blog articles
- Paste directly or provide URLs/file paths

**Option B - Brand Description**
If you don't have content yet, describe:
1. **Industry/Product**: What do you sell?
2. **Target Audience**: Who are you talking to?
3. **Brand Personality**: 3-5 adjectives that describe your brand
4. **Brands You Admire**: Whose voice do you like? (competitors or not)
5. **Avoid Sounding Like**: What tone would be wrong for you?

I'll analyze patterns and create your voice guide."

## Analysis Process

### If Content Provided (Option A)

Extract patterns across all samples:

**Voice Patterns to Identify:**
- Sentence length distribution (short/medium/long)
- Use of contractions (can't vs cannot)
- First/second/third person preference
- Active vs passive voice ratio
- Question usage frequency
- Exclamation point usage
- Emoji/punctuation style
- Paragraph length patterns
- Opening patterns (how pieces start)
- Closing patterns (how pieces end)

**Vocabulary Patterns:**
- Recurring power words
- Industry jargon usage (heavy/light/none)
- Colloquialisms and slang
- Metaphor and analogy patterns
- Words that appear frequently
- Words that are notably absent

**Tone Markers:**
- Formality level (1-10 scale)
- Humor usage (frequent/occasional/never)
- Confidence level (bold claims vs hedging)
- Emotional warmth (distant vs intimate)
- Authority stance (peer vs expert vs mentor)

### If Description Provided (Option B)

Use WebSearch to find:
- Example content from admired brands
- Industry voice benchmarks
- Competitor voice analysis
- Audience communication preferences

Then synthesize a voice based on inputs.

Recommend quarterly reviews.
